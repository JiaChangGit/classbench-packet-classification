請參考img folder截圖，來對程式做修改。

classbench有兩個版本

https://www.arl.wustl.edu/classbench/

https://github.com/classbench-ng/classbench-ng

舊版的能跑出100K，新版的等太久只用20K來check可以run

(這邊的有修改，應該可以直接make)

Please refer to the img folder screenshot to make modifications to the program.

There are two versions of classbench

https://www.arl.wustl.edu/classbench/

https://github.com/classbench-ng/classbench-ng

The old version can run 100K, but the new version can run after waiting too long and only use 20K to check.

(There are modifications here, it should be possible to make directly)
